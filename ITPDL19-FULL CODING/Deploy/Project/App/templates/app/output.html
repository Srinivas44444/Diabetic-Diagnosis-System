        <h2>Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy Detected</h2>
        <p>Your uploaded image has been analyzed, and the condition detected is Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR). This is an advanced stage of diabetic retinopathy, and it requires immediate attention and management. Below is detailed information on understanding, managing, and treating this condition.</p>

        <h3>Understanding Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR)</h3>
        <p>Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) is the most advanced stage of diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. In PDR, abnormal new blood vessels (neovascularization) start to grow on the surface of the retina or into the vitreous gel, the fluid that fills the eye. These new vessels are fragile and can bleed into the eye, leading to vision loss or blindness if not treated promptly.</p>

        <h4>What Causes Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy?</h4>
        <p>PDR is caused by prolonged high blood sugar levels that damage the blood vessels in the retina. This damage leads to poor blood flow, causing the retina to grow new blood vessels that are weak and prone to bleeding. Risk factors include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Long-standing Diabetes:</strong> The longer you have diabetes, especially if it is poorly controlled, the higher the risk of developing PDR.</li>
            <li><strong>Uncontrolled Blood Sugar:</strong> Poor management of blood sugar levels increases the risk of PDR.</li>
            <li><strong>High Blood Pressure:</strong> Hypertension can exacerbate retinal damage.</li>
            <li><strong>High Cholesterol:</strong> Elevated cholesterol levels can contribute to blood vessel damage in the retina.</li>
            <li><strong>Pregnancy:</strong> Pregnancy can increase the risk of diabetic retinopathy progressing to PDR.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Signs and Symptoms</h4>
        <p>Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy may not cause noticeable symptoms until significant damage has occurred. When symptoms do occur, they may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Floaters or dark spots in your vision</li>
            <li>Blurred vision</li>
            <li>Sudden loss of vision</li>
            <li>Poor night vision</li>
            <li>Difficulty seeing colors</li>
            <li>Vision loss in severe cases</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Management and Treatment</h3>
        <p>Immediate management of PDR is crucial to prevent further vision loss. Treatment options may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Laser Treatment (Panretinal Photocoagulation):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the most common treatment for PDR. The laser creates small burns in the retina to stop the growth of new blood vessels and seal the leaky ones.</li>
                    <li>The procedure may require more than one session and is typically performed in an outpatient setting.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Anti-VEGF Injections:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Medications that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can be injected into the eye to reduce new blood vessel growth and swelling.</li>
                    <li>These injections may need to be repeated over time to maintain effectiveness.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Vitrectomy:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This surgical procedure may be necessary if there is significant bleeding (vitreous hemorrhage) or scarring in the eye. It involves removing the vitreous gel and replacing it with a clear solution.</li>
                    <li>Vitrectomy can also be used to repair retinal detachment caused by PDR.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Blood Sugar Control:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tight control of blood sugar levels is critical to slowing the progression of PDR and preventing further damage.</li>
                    <li>Work closely with your healthcare provider to manage your diabetes effectively.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Blood Pressure and Cholesterol Management:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Controlling blood pressure and cholesterol levels can help reduce the risk of worsening PDR.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Regular Eye Exams:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Frequent eye examinations are essential to monitor the progression of PDR and adjust treatment as needed.</li>
                    <li>Your eye care specialist may recommend exams as often as every 3 to 4 months.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Precautions and Preventative Measures</h3>
        <p>Preventing PDR or managing it effectively involves several critical steps:</p>
